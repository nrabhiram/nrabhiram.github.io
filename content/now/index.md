Welcome to the "now" section of my site, where I talk about what I'm up to right now! I try to maintain monthly logs of my life that cover highlights, new experiences, learning updates, progress on projects, books I read, movies I watched, games I tried out, and my general headspace.

You can find the links to my logs in the navbar in reverse chronological order.

## Snapshot

Here's a snapshot of me (kept *current-ish*, I try). 

If you're interested in learning more about me (I'm flattered), check out [`/about/me`](/about/me).

      <p>I'm currently juggling between a few of them. I'm adhering to this practice of having at most 3 in my rotation at any given time. This ensures that I don't deviate as much, build momentum, and switch between projects if I'm lacking the motivation to work on one.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sapphire</strong> - A bespoke site generator that respects the organization of <code>.md</code> files to create pages and the navigation system.</li>
        <li><strong>Vaxitas</strong> - My personal site, an extension of my self, hence why I thought a moniker to be fitting. It treats ideas and content as first class citizens. Considers <em>text as a universal interface</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Shirou-TP</strong> - A small and opinionated UI library, written in Svelte. Consists of self-sufficient and headless components such as a virtualized table and a looping carousel.</li>

    <div class="card-heading">Struggles</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gaining momentum</strong> - Whether it's learning new things or trying new activities, I find it challenging to make headway. I'm exploring how I can be more focused and deliberate with my personal time. Maybe finding groups with similar goals and interests will help.</li>
      <li><strong>Loneliness</strong> - I don't live in close proximity to most people whom I consider my friends or peers. I'm also not keen on making new acquaintances in my city because I hold an opinion (that I'm seeking to break) that people here are vapid. My friends are always welcoming whenever I visit. I'd love to host them as well, so I'm encouraging them to come over sometimes.</li>
      <li><strong>Gluttony</strong> - There are some things I relish, that I tend to overdo to the point of disgust.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="card-section">
    <div class="card-heading">Triumphs</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A friend visited me in HYD.</strong> I hadn't shared with him my intent to host others, so I was touched. We met for breakfast once and played with my badminton pick-up group the next day.</li>
      <li><strong>Shipping this site.</strong> Easily one of the most important things I've built and done for myself.</li>
      <li><strong>Found a badminton pick-up group with great games in HYD.</strong> I cannot emphasize enough how monumental a task this is.</li>
      <li><strong>Listened to my first album end-to-end</strong>: <em>Saturation I</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Completed Aria of Sorrow</strong> - I played through 2 runs, and got the 3 main endings.</li>
      <li><strong>Watched movies solo in the theatres</strong> - <em>Sinners</em> and <em>Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning</em>.</li>
    </ul>
