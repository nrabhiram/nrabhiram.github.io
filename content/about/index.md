If you're curious about the website or the person behind it, you've reached the right place!

You can read more about me, i.e. the writer, creator, and owner of this site (that sounded a lot better in my head) at [`/about/me`](/about/me). I attempt to talk about myself in greater detail; the work I do, my interests, and hobbies. Eventually, when I find the time, I aim to add a timeline of important canon events in my life.

You can read about my thoughts on why I think this site is meaningful to me and my intents with it at [`/about/vaxitas`](/about/vaxitas). I've written this: 

- primarily for myself, 
- close ones with whom I can use this site as a means of communication, 
- and people who've stumbled upon this site and are keen on exploring it further.
