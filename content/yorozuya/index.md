summary: I set up shop here for all sorts of odd jobs (T&C apply) and attempt to make a case for why you should collaborate with me for your next project.

I'm a huge proponent of the web's underlying mechanism of serendipity. I believe that sharing more about myself on the internet can lead to chance encounters. I hope that this page can help me establish project-specific relationships with you. If you're doing something that aligns with what I've listed out in the [`/about/me`](/about/me) and [`/now`](/now) pages, it's likely that we'd enjoy working together!

Inspired by [Gintoki](https://gintama.fandom.com/wiki/Yorozuya_Gin-chan), this page is where I set up shop. *Yorozuya* in Japanese roughly translates to "a house that does all sorts of odd jobs". I find this apt (and humorous) because I too don't have a set of skills that I can neatly package into a service and offer to you. But, on the other hand, I'm trying to be more selective about the gigs that come my way. I only consider working on a project if I feel strongly about it and I'm confident that I  can contribute in its current state. 

I also ardently want to collaborate with others and I want to do it more frequently. That's why I want you to get a feel of what it's like to have me as a collaborator. Below, I've tried to:

- introduce what I do professionally
- share my strengths and interests

    <div class="card-heading">What can I do for you?</div>
    <p><strong>Are you looking to build a software product? One that people love interacting with and find themselves re-visiting often?</strong> The best products often borrow from world-building principles and have their own languages within the context of the project. Users are progressively familiarized with this language, and the intricacies are introduced gradually. Such products view design and engineering as two sides of the same coin.</p>
    <p>So far, I have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helped build the frontend and UI system of a <a href="https://farcaster.xyz/~/channel/castmoney" target="_blank">social DeFi product</a> that won at the <a href="https://devfolio.co/projects/castmoney-feed-cc53" target="_blank">Based India Hackathon</a></li>
      <li>Helped build NFL fantasy tools that have amassed thousands of visitors daily, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chargers/comments/1iesblj/pfn_mock_offseason_bored_at_work_let_me_know_what/" target="_blank">great reviews</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chargers/comments/1iigdxc/simulated_offseason_analysis/" target="_blank">from fanatics</a></li>
      <li>Helped build a telemedicine app for doctors to continue their practice online during COVID</li>
    </ul>

      <div class="card-heading">Strengths</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Making websites and web applications</strong> that are delightful to use, well-optimized, and easy to maintain. I'm stack-agnostic. In fact, I've built plenty of applications in vanilla JS, although my preferred tool these days is Svelte.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating cinematic 3D sequences (and basic video editing)</strong> - If you're looking to make trailers or short films, I have experience with making <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHB0fdOUMX-3BFOQxV1vJPTAW4OsNEk5j&si=fKiuTul7EveXkdkN" target="_blank">small scenes in Unreal</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototyping games</strong>, deciding which platform to launch on, doing research, designing mechanics and game loops, building game systems, and writing documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Anything badminton related</strong>; be it organizing a tournament, hosting pick-up games, tying grips for your racquets, sparring, or teaching someone how to play.</li>
        <li><strong>Writing</strong> essays, documentation, stories, or even copy for your website.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating software tools and little libraries</strong> for static-site-generation (SSG), sophisticated UI components, etc. Anything that helps the end user/developer.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card-section">
      <div class="card-heading">Interests</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Organizing events</strong>, tournaments, meetups, pickup games, house parties, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpreters and compilers</strong> - I've a newfound obsession with programming language theory (PLT) and I'm looking for interesting opportunities in the space. It's been explored by people who are smarter and more invested than I am. But, there are still many domains in which these principles and techniques can be applied to improve the experience of users. In the future, I'd love to contribute to Svelte.</li>
        <li><strong>Games and tooling</strong> - I'm particularly interested in the Metroidvania genre and games that have non-linear progression. Another idea that I'd like to work on in the future is a game-making framework built on top of Raylib.</li>
        <li><strong>Software products</strong> of all sorts. An idea I'm currently keen on exploring personally is RSS readers. But, I'm open to working on any creative idea.</li>
        <li><strong>Working on media projects</strong> in all formats ranging from writing blogs, essays, stories, videos, devlogs, games, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Forming small groups</strong> of committed friends/peers for niche interests: study groups, collaborators for projects, pick-up groups for sports, etc.</li>
      </ul>
